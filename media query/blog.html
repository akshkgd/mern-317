        <p>Netflix has now brought in support for Spatial Audio for some of its original shows for an immersive audio experience and rival Apple TV+ and more video platforms.</p>
        <h1>These Netflix Shows Support Spatial Audio</h1>
        <p>Netflix is rolling out Spatial Audio support for a few shows for now and the list includes the popular Stranger Things 4, The Adam Project, The Witcher, Red Notice, and more. Netflix reveals that people can simply search for content that supports Spatial Audio by typing the term in the search bar.</p>
        <p>The video streaming platform is using the Sennheiser AMBEO for a surround sound experience without any additional equipment. Plus, it works on all devices and streaming plans. It is suggested that Spatial Audio will be enabled automatically if there are no surround sound speakers available. If they are, watching content in 5.1 surround sound or Dolby Atmos is recommended.</p>
